RoutetoUni is a web-based application that is designed to help first year
students studying at Newcastle University. The application supports many
different pages that would to relate to questions a typical first year
student would ask. Along with individual pages showing information there is
a trained bot that will answer any questions a user would have.
  
A user can create an account and join a chatroom in which they will be randomly assigned with
 other first year students on the same course as them. If a student is a peer mentor he/she is
  able to answer questions that the chat bot is unable to.
