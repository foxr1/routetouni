                            <li>Keep your notes organised – if you can’t find them, there’s no point taking them! Use different notebooks for each module so that your notes do not get mixed up.</li>
                            <li>Read around topics – consult recommended texts for more detailed information. Don’t expect to get all of the required information during the lecture.</li>
                            <li>Be wary of taking too many notes. Try consolidating your notes into one document for revision purposes.</li>

                            <li>Write notes on any PowerPoint handouts next to the appropriate slide.</li>
                            <li>Do not try to write everything that the lecturer is saying – note key points and items which are not on any lecture handouts. Use bullet points to note things down quickly.</li>
                            <li>Sometimes it is more productive to just listen during the lecture and then make notes later using Recap.</li>
